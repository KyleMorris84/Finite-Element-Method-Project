\chapter{Results}
\label{chapter3}

%<Results, evaluation (including user evaluation) {\em etc.} should be described in one or more chapters. See the `Results and Discussion' criterion in the mark scheme for the sorts of material that may be included here.>

\section{Agile development}
**Here I should discuss the success of the agile methodology in allowing me to perform rapid changes and meet user requirements better. How easy was it to make changes? How many changes were requested and what was the scale of those changes? Did users agree or disagree and how did I reconcile that? **

\section{Evaluation of user feedback}

\subsection{User data}
** Present data collected from users. Briefly discuss my impressions of how users found the course from their responses to the final questionnaire. **

\subsection{Analysis}
** Compare their responses with some resource I can find online. Maybe an empirical study has done something similar. As always, provide plenty of references. As a result of the comparison, evaluate what was successful and what was unsuccessful about the project. Could compare against more advanced online educational services (codecademy, brilliant, khan etc). **
