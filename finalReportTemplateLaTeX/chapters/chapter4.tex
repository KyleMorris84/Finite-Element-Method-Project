\label{chapter4}

%<Everything that comes under the `Results and Discussion' criterion in the mark scheme that has not been addressed in an earlier chapter should be included in this final chapter. The following section headings are suggestions only.>

\section{Conclusions}

** Did I meet the project goals set out at the start? Do I fully know if it was a success or a failure and why? What would I do differently if I were to do it again? **

\section{Ideas for future work}

** Possibility for using more sophisticated means of teaching. Deeper exploration of Finite Element Analysis, maybe room for a part 2 to the course? **
