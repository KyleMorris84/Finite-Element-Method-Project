    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third notebook in my series \"Understanding and Using the Finite Element Method\". Over the course of the last 2 notebooks we have covered much of the 'understanding' part; the mathematical theory for the method. Now it is time for implementation. We will use a specialised computing platform called FEniCSx. I say 'computing platform' and not 'library', because FEniCSx is a collection of libraries that can work together to construct and solve FEM problems.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To gain an overview of the different components of FEniCSx.\n",
    "- To be able to construct and solve time-independent PDEs (BVPs) in FEniCSx, including generating meshes, defining mathematical objects and solving, as well as being able to make the right choices for each parameter.\n",
    "- To be able to visualise the solutions obtained in various ways, through colour plots, 3d plots and 2d \"slices\".\n",
    "- To be able to construct finite difference approximations for time-dependent PDEs (IVBPs), solve them, and visualise the solution with an animation."

    "As mentioned before, FEniCSx is an open source computation platform used to construct and solve PDEs using the Finite Element Method. FEniCSx has four main components, although if you decide to look at the Docker image we are hosting Jupyter on, you will see there are many more dependencies needed to actually run it. This, in fact, is why we use a Docker image instead of manually installing all python packages. Many of them cannot be installed via the Package Installer for Python (pip) and require some amount of effort to install. The Docker image is incredibly convenient, the one we use here was created by Jorgen S. Dokken for his FEniCSx tutorial series. The four main components of FEniCSx are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DOLFINx** - This is the main computational backend of FEniCSx. It is the backbone that connects all of the other libraries together and contains the majority of classes and functions. It contains interfaces for input/output, mesh generation, linear equation solvers, manipulation of finite function spaces, and much [more](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/main/python/api.html).\n",
    "- **UFL** - Unified Form Language is the language used to express variational forms of PDEs. It's syntax is designed to be as close to writing the actual mathematics as possible. You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/ufl/2022.2.0/).\n",
    "- **FFCx** - The FEniCSx Form Compiler takes a variational form in UFL and compiles it into a linear system of equations, i.e. the mass matrix and load vector. Documentation for this can be found [here](https://github.com/FEniCS/ffcx).\n",
    "- **Basix** - This deals with the finite elements themselves. It can generate the basis functions of some space and their derivatives, as well as perform interpolation, projection and [more](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/basix/v0.2.0/python/)."

    "We've defined our full variational problem! Now all we have to do is convert it to a linear problem and solve. DOLFINx has a class called `fem.petsc.LinearProblem` for this specific purpose. PETSc stands for Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, and is a linear algebra backend designed specifically for solving partial differential equations. It is not developed specifically for FEniCSx, but the `dolfinx.fem.petsc` class allows us to convert our problems defined in DOLFINx into problems for PETSc to solve. The `LinearProblem` class is used specifically for problems in bilinear form, that is $a(u,v) = L(v) \\,  \\forall v \\in V_h$. The arguments are: a bilinear UFL form (LHS), a linear UFL form (RHS), a list of boundary conditions, and some linear solver options. The number of available matrix solvers is very vast, each will have pros and cons and some will be more efficient depending on your use case. We will talk briefly about a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LU-Factorisation** is a commonly-used method of solving systems of linear equations. This method splits our mass matrix  $\\boldsymbol{A}$ into two matrices, $\\boldsymbol{L}$ and $\\boldsymbol{U}$ such that $\\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{L} \\, \\boldsymbol{U}$, where $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is lower triangular and $\\boldsymbol{U}$ is upper triangular. We can then write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{Ac} &= \\boldsymbol{b} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{LUc} &= \\boldsymbol{b} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{L} ( \\boldsymbol{Uc} ) &= \\boldsymbol{b}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means we can instead solve, $\\boldsymbol{Lc'} = \\boldsymbol{b}$ and then $\\boldsymbol{Uc} = \\boldsymbol{c'}$. This is a much easier problem to solve, because triangular systems of equations can be solved using back/forward substitution, which is a very quick method. Another reason this method is good is because it will always give us a correct solution. It is a so called **direct** method, meaning there is no estimation in the process of solving. The downside of direct methods is that they are generally more expensive than others. For a system with millions of degrees of freedom, they would not be the correct choice. Other direct methods include Gaussian elimination, Cholesky decomposition and QR decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main type of linear solvers are **iterative**. Examples of these include Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. Iterative solvers work by making \"guesses\" of the solution and then using this guess to make a more accurate guess in the next iteration. The process varies from algorithm to algorithm, but these iterative solvers generally outperform direct solvers where appropriate. Another benefit of iterative solvers, is that they can make use of a matrix's **sparseness** to decrease the number of wasted calculations (multiplying by 0). A sparse matrix is just a matrix that contains many $0$ entries. The problem with iterative solvers however, is that they do not always converge to a solution. Their convergence depends on the **spectral radius** of the mass matrix, therefore one should be careful and ensure they will get a correct result when using one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If efficiency were our main concern, possibly because of a very large mesh, we would try to adjust the PETSc options we use to the get the best result. A list of full PETSc options is available [here](https://petsc4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/ksp/). We decide to proceed with the direct method of LU-Factorisation for this demo however, since we have a relatively small mesh size and it keeps things relatively simple. It is specified below in the `petsc-options`."

    "These are both good, simple ways of viewing the solution. We can obtain a more abstracted view through a kind of contour plot. A contour plot is a way of visualising 3D surfaces in 2D, by fixing the $z$ value of a function and drawing all points at that value, forming a contour line. One can think of the contour line as a horizontal \"slice\" through the $z$-axis. This can be done for many different $z$ values to form a contour plot. While this is a useful technique for visualising our solution, we will use a slightly different method where we instead fix the $x$ value of our function and plot $y$ against $z$. We obtain a slice through our surface in the $x$-direction instead. Below I have decided to evaluate along the line $x=0.5$, which is through the middle of our domain.\n",

    "3. Plot these values of $u_h$ against the $y$-values of our line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The block below implements step 1. Numpy's array manipulation techniques have been used to create a set of points that define the line $x=0.5$ in three dimensions. So `points` is a three-dimensional array with `points[0]=x` being an array of one hundred $0.5$'s, `points[1]=y` being a sequence of one hundred equally spaced points over the interval $[0,1]$, and `points[2]=z` being an array of one hundred zeroes."

    "Now we need to evaluate $u_h$ at these points. The `dolfinx.function` class contains the method `.eval()` which is used for exactly this purpose. It has 2 parameters, firstly it takes an array of points to evaluate the function over. The second parameter an array of indices of the finite elements  (cells), where each the $i$-th cell contains the $i$-th point in the first parameter. The eval function uses these cells to reduce the number of times $\\phi_i(x)$ has to be evaluated, because outside of the $i$-th cell, $\\phi_i(x)$ is $0$, so the function does not need to be evaluated.

    "To find the cell that each point is contained within, we can create a data structure called a bounding box tree. In 2-Dimensions, a **bounding box** for some cell is the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that can contain wholly contain the cell. The concept can extend to three dimensions as well, where we use a cuboid instead of a rectangle. We can group intersecting bounding boxes together inside larger bounding boxes, and we can further group these parent bounding boxes into larger ones, which leads to a hierarchical structure. This strucute lends itself well to being described by trees, where each layer in the tree is one of these groups. So we use a **bounding box tree** data structure to store this information. Below is an example of a bounding box tree, sometimes called a bounding volume hierarchy.\n",

    "The advantage to creating a bounding box tree, is that we can determine which cell a point $x$ is in very efficiently, using a recursive search on the tree.

    "In our implementation, the `geometry.BoundingBoxTree()` function creates a bounding box tree of our mesh. Then, we get a list of all the bounding boxes that intersect with each of the points on our line using `compute_collisions`. Then for each of these, we add the cells that actually collide with the point, not just the cells whose bounding boxes do. This will typically just be one cell, but sometimes a point can lie on the boundary between cells, meaning we have to specify further. If there is more than one to choose, we just choose the first in the order they are provided. Once all the appropriate cells have been found, we can use the `.eval()` method to obtain the values of $u_h$ on our line."

They vary from being wildly innacurate, so fairly close. Beyond $n=256$, results became difficult to distinguish from each other, so it is safe to assume this is the solution the method is converging on."

    "The choice of problem was not random, indeed it as contructed using the *method of manufactured solutions*, meaning there is an analytical $u$ that solves \\[9\\]. You can clearly see that substituting in $u_D = 20y^\\frac12 + \\frac12 x^2 + 2x$ for $u$ solves the equation on $\\delta \\Omega$, but the source term $f = 5y^{-\\frac32} - 1$ was chosen specifically so that $-\\nabla u_D = f$. So $u_D$ solves \\[9\\] on $\\Omega$ as well. A plot of $u_D$ through the line $x=0.5$ is shown below, and as you can see, bares striking resemblance to our finite element approximations with larger mesh sizes. Some PDEs won't need so many finite elements to solve, and others will need more to provide an accurate soltuion, but it is surprising how bad the approximations are with smaller numbers of elements in this instance."

    "The wave equation is a time-dependent Partial Differential Equation describing the propogation of waves through a medium. It is  used to describe electromagentic waves, water waves, the vibration of a string, and many other physical phenomena. As such, it is important in many areas of physics to be able to solve the wave equation. While it is possible to solve certain instances of the wave equation analytically, we will use FEniCSx to obtian a numerical solution that can be applied to all instances of the equation. We begin by defining the equation itself, as well as a boundary condition and a initial conditions.\n",

    "In the equation, $u$ is the waves position, and is a function of $x$, $y$ and $t$. $c$ is the speed of the wave. Our domain $\\Omega$ is the the square $[-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$. We have chosen a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition because it provides for a more simple visualisation. The inital condition we have chosen is a 2-Dimensional Gaussian function centered at the origin with a height of $\\alpha$. There is no great significance to this, merely that it provides an interesting solution at the end. You can also see on line 4 that we have a second intial condition this time specifiying that the derivative of the wave's position should be $0$ initially. This must be specified because we have a second order derivative with respect to time in the equation. An interpretation of this condition would be that this is the waves initial velocity."

    "To solve we proceed slightly differently than before. Instead of solving just one problem, we have $n+1$ problems, each relying on the previous problems for input. We will need to iterate over the time domain, incrementing `dt` until we reach `T`. Then, one approach would be to define and solve a new `fem.petsc.LinearProblem()` in each iteration, using the $u^n$ and $u^{n-1}$ from the previous time steps in the linear and bilinear forms. However, this is inefficient. You can see from [14], that the bilinear form $a(u^{n+1},v)$ does not change with each time step. Therefore, when constructing the linear equation, the mass matrix $A$ will be the same for every equation $n=0,1,\\cdots$. Instead of reassembling the whole system at each time step, we only need to reassemble the term that changes with time, which is dictated by the linear form. The linear form corresponds to the load vector, refer to section 3.4 for a refresher on how the linear and bilinear forms become the load vector and mass matrix. Therefore, it is most efficient to assemble $A$ at $t=0$ and continue to use it throughout.\n",
