# Third Year Project: Learning Resources for Understanding and Using the Finite Element Method

## What is the project all about?

Hello, welcome to the Github page for my final year project at the University of Leeds. My project is about the creation of learning resources for the understanding and use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in Python. Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, I endeavour to teach the subject in the most engaging, interesting and effective way possible. To achieve this, I will be taking an evidence-based approach where I review methods from published literature and studies on mathematical education. The goal is then to obtain the best possible solutions and compile them into a course on FEM.

Once the outline has been created, I can begin the development which will follow an agile methodology. It will include rapid phases of development, followed by user testing, followed by amendments if necessary. Then, once all notebooks have been tested and the course has been effectively completed, I will get a final response from the testers, giving their opinions on the material as a whole. I can then use this data to evaluate the success of the project and to motivate any further work in the field.

## Aims & Objectives for the project

Key objectives for the project include:

* To gain a good enough understanding of Finite Element Analysis for me to write effective learning material on the subject.

* To research good educational practice. I.e. How to most effectively engage students and maximise retention.

* To follow an agile development methodology and use it to create notebooks in an efficient, user-led manner.

* To evaluate the effectiveness of the notebooks by comparing user responses to published literature.

## Other Information

Thank you for taking the time to check out the Github page! This is a private repository as per the University of Leeds' policy. This is mainly for storing the progress of my report, and other documents that help me along my development journey. Also the notebooks themselves will have a copy stored here. I don't plan for the users to be able to access this repoistory, so the notebooks will probably be hosted somewhere else as well.
