%<Concise statement of the problem you intended to solve and main achievements (no more than one A4 page)>

The aim of this project is to address the issue of the mathematical complexity of the finite element method and create a set of learning resources that can be used to bridge the gap in understanding required to use FEM. The goal is to guide students through the mathematics as well as instruct them on how to implement the method themselves. In this report I will describe the background research done to influence my design decisions, detail the writing process, and discuss the results obtained from user feedback.
