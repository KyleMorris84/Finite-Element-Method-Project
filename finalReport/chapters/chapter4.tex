\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter4}

%<Everything that comes under the `Results and Discussion' criterion in the mark scheme that has not been addressed in an earlier chapter should be included in this final chapter. The following section headings are suggestions only.>

\subsection{Analysis}
** Compare their responses with some resource I can find online. Maybe an empirical study has done something similar. As always, provide plenty of references. As a result of the comparison, evaluate what was successful and what was unsuccessful about the project. Could compare against more advanced online educational services (codecademy, brilliant, khan etc). ** 

\section{Conclusions}

** Did I meet the project goals set out at the start? Do I fully know if it was a success or a failure and why? What would I do differently if I were to do it again? **

\section{Ideas for future work}

** Possibility for using more sophisticated means of teaching. Deeper exploration of Finite Element Analysis, maybe room for a part 2 to the course? **
