    "Welcome to the second notebook in my series \"Understanding and Using the Finite Element Method\". We now have a strong enough mathematical foundation to begin introducing new mathematics, which will help us define the algorithm that is FEM. We will start in 1-dimensional problems, with domains that lie strictly on the x-axis, and work our way up to 2."

    "\n",
    "where $u$ and $f$ are single variable functions of $x$. Since, for now, we are only concerned with 1-dimensional functions, partial differential equations are the same as differential equations, because there is only one variable to differentiate with respect to. For most $f$, we can easily solve this by integrating twice, but it will serve as an example for this chapter. We can check the difference between our answer and analytical solution, and calculate the error between the two. More importantly however, this approach will work even for complicated functions that we cannot integrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of FEM is to produce a suitable approximation of $u$ that solves (1). It is done by splitting the domain up into a set of small regions called a mesh. Then, we assume our approximation of $u$, denoted $u_h$ is a combination of straight lines, one from each of the individual regions on our mesh. We can also rewrite (1) in a new way, called the variational form. Finally, we insert our $u_h$ in for $u$, which provides us with a system of linear equations we can solve, to find the values of our approximated function. This is the general outline of how FEM works in 1D, and the higher dimensional versions work very similarly too!\n",

    "Let's focus on a single sub-interval $J = [x_0, x_1]$. Since our solution should be a collection of straight lines, this sub-interval should contain a linear polynomial. We encountered the space of polynomials of at most degree $n$ in section 1.1, so for linear polynomials we have $P_1(J)$. Functions from $P_1(J)$ take the form $v(x) = c_0 + c_1x$. The most obvious choise of basis would therefore be the standard basis $\\{ 1, x \\}$, since any $v\\in P_1(I_i)$ could be specified by only $c_0$ and $c_1$. \n",

    "We should add a quick side note to talk about the function spaces involved here. In order for the above to be true, we must have that $v$ and $v'$ are **square integrable** on $I$. For some function $f$ to be square integrable, the integral $\\int_I |f(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x$ must be finite. The space of square integrable functions defined on some interval $I$ is called $L^2(I)$, which is an **inner product space** defined with the inner product $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_I \\bar{f}g \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Since $\\bar{f}f=|f|^2$, an equivalent definition of square integrability is that $\\langle f, f \\rangle_{L^2(I)} < \\infty$. It then follows that $L^2(I)$ is a **Hilbert Space**. So, in order for the above to be true, we must have $v, v' \\in L^2(I)$, but this is precisely the definition of the **Sobloev space** $H^1(I)$ equipped with the $L^2$ inner product. A Sobloev space is just a Hilbert space where derivatives must be square integrable as well. Therefore, we must have $v \\in H^1(I)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a glimpse into the world of functional analysis, and while it is certainly interesting, you might be wondering how this pertains to solving PDEs? Well, the useful thing about $H^1$ is that it permits functions that have discontinuous derivatives. This is extremely useful, because our piecewise continuous linear polynomials have discontinuous derivatives. You can take a look again at Fig.7 to convince yourself this is true. This means we can transform our weak formulation, which at the minute is a continuous problem, into one that allows for piecewise polynomials to approximate it. Hence, we define the space\n",
