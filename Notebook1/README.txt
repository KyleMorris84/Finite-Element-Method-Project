To run this notebook, you will need to upload all files to JupyterLab. The steps on how to do this are listed below.

1. Run your docker container and head to the local ip address hosting JupterLab. Information about how to do this is in the setup guide.

2. The left-hand side is where your files are stored, the right-hand side is where the content is displayed. You should see a mostly empty directory, if there are any files present you should delete them.

3. Right click somewhere on the left and create a New Folder. Name it after the current notebook.

4. If you haven't already done so, download the the notebook and all other files associated with the notebook from GitHub. Navigate into your new folder and press the up-arrow symbol to upload files. Select all files and upload.

5. The .ipynb file is the notebook file. Double click it to launch. If prompted to choose a kernel, choose Python 3 (ipykernel).
