    "One example of a vector space is the space $F^n$, whose vectors are just ordered $n$-tuples of elements of $F$. Vectors from this space are often notated stacked in columns and are simply called *vectors* by most. Another example would be the set $M_{m,n}(F)$, which is the set of $m \\times n$ matrices whose entries are from $F$. This space is not commutative, since matrix multiplication depends on the order of operations.\n",

For instance, consider the space of polynomials of at most degree $n$, denoted $P_n$. This is a space comprised of polynomial functions of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, with $f(x)=c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 \\cdots c_nx^n$ and $c_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

    "Another important concept is **linear dependence**. A set of vectors is linearly dependent if the following equation for some fixed set of vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\underline{v_0}} \\cdots \\boldsymbol{\\underline{v_n}}\\}$ has a non-trivial solution.

This motivates our informal definition of linear dependence: A set of vectors is linearly dependent if any vector in that set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors; which is what we have in the final line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving linear dependence for a set of vectors is as simple as finding a linear combination of those vectors that creates one of the vectors in the set. Equivalently, we can find a non-trivial solution to [1]. Therefore, to prove linear independence we must prove that the only solution to [1] is the trivial solution $c_i=0$ for all $i = 0, \\cdots, n$. To determine if [1] has another solution, we rewrite it as a system of linear equations by defining $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{x}}=(x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n)$ and a matrix $M$, whose $i$-th column is $v_i$.

    "Our final defintion for the chapter will be a **basis**. A basis $U$, with respect to some vector space $V$, is a set of vectors from $V$ that spans $V$ and is linearly independent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In $\\mathbb{R}^2$ it should be clear that $U_1=\\{ (1, 0), (0, 1) \\}$ is a spanning set. We can write a generic vector $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{v}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ as $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{v}} = (c_0, c_1)$ for some $c_0,c_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then the linear combination  $c_0(1,0) + c_1(0,1) = (c_0, c_1)$ describes such a vector. Proving linear independence is also trivial since in our linear equation, $M$ will be the identity matrix, which is it's own inverse and therefore, the only solution is $c_0=c_1=0$. Hence $U$ is a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This set is called the *standard basis* for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and can expand to $n$ dimensions in a similar way.\n",

We consider the equation [1] $c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 \\cdots c_nx^n = 0$. One approach to solving this kind of equation would be equating coefficients of powers of $x$. Doing so leads us to the only solution, which is the trivial one. This may be harder to see than the previous example, but recall we are solving only for $c_i$ and not $x$. As such the equation must remain true for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ (the functions' domain). This is also the standard basis for $P_n$.\n",

    "- Other bases exist than the standard basis, for instance $U_3=\\{ 17, 2-x, x+\\frac{x^2}{4} \\}$. This is a basis of $P_2$ and can be proved by linearly transforming each element of $U_3$ into an element of the standard basis. This just means constructing a linear combination for each element.\n",

So we can convert any of our vectors from $U_3$ into vectors in the standard basis. We already know we can obtain any element in $P_2$ through a linear combination of vectors from the standard basis. Therefore, it must be the case that there is a linear combination of vectors in $U_3$ that can produce produce any vector in $P_2$, since we only have to compose these linear combinations.

    "Now we have reviewed our understanding of vector spaces, we should now review the language of PDEs; vector calculus. I am going to assume a baseline knowledge here, most of this should be a refresher, so I won't be going over the definitions of regular derivatives or integrals. We should first review the idea of scalar vs vector fields. This is very different from the fields spoken about in section 1.1. Here field is essentially another word for a function, the distinction being that a field typically acts on space, whereas a function could be acting on anything. A **scalar field** is a field that maps each point in space to a single value, a scalar. A **vector field** is a field that maps each point to multiple values, a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the function $t:\\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ could denote the temperature at each point in three-dimensional space. This would be a scalar field, because temperature is a scalar value. An example of a vector field might be $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{V}}:\\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^3$, denoting the velocity of a fluid in three-dimensional space. Each point in space is mapped to 3 values, an $x$-component, a $y$-component and a $z$-component of the point's velocity. These components form a vector and hence $v$ is a vector field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can talk about partial derivatives. Consider the scalar field $f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. We can take the derivative of $f$ with respect to any of the variables in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, while keeping the others constant. This is called a **partial derivative** and is useful for examining the rate of change of a function when only one of the variables changes. So if we have $f(x,y,z)$, we can define the first partial derivative of $f$ to be $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ or $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$. It is calculated by taking a regular derivative and treating the other variables as constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if $f(x,y,z)= x^2(\\log(x) + \\sin(y)\\cos(z))$, the three first partial derivatives of $f$ are,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = x^2\\sin(y)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\Big[cos(z)\\Big] = -x^2\\sin(y)\\sin(z) \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Second, third and higher partial derivatives are calculated similarly, we simply perform the differentiation twice to calculate. We can also have **mixed partial derivaties**, where we first differentiate with respect to one variable and then another, e.g. $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}$. One can also take the partial derivative of a vector field. This means we just perform the differentiation to each component."

But there are other things we can do with partial derivatives, and there are ways to apply them to vector fields as well to learn things about them. A differential operator is a just like a regular operator such as $\\times$ or $+$, but is typically a *unary* operator, so only has one input.\n",

    "We want to intuitively determine the curl of these fields, or if they have curl any at all. To do this, imagine the vectors represent fluid velocity. Then imagine dropping a beach ball in the fluid. This is a special beach ball in that it can only rotate at it's fixed position and cannot move. For each of the fields above, try to imagine if it will spin, and if so, which way.\n",

    "The field on the right appears as though it would have curl, but it actually does not. Try to imagine the ball again. This time, the inner arrows are much larger, which spins the ball clockwise, but the outer vectors are trying to spin the ball anticlockwise. This is not abnormal, but in this case the magnitudes of the vectors match perfectly to result in no spin at all. The beach ball would remain still."

    "To find the axis of rotation, we use the right hand rule. This involves curling your fingers in the direction of the rotation, then the direction your thumb is pointing is the axis. So in Fig.1, since the ball is spinning counter clockwise, our thumb points away from us, in the negative $y$ direction, so the field has negative curl. A field with no curl at every point ($\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\underline{F}} = \\boldsymbol{\\underline{0}}$) is called **irrotational**."

    "Many other differential operators exist, such as the Laplacian and Material Derivative. We will encounter these later when studying the definitons of different PDEs. For now, we will discuss another important concept in vector calculus: multiple dimensional integration. The ultimate goal is to gain understanding of a result called the Divergence theorem, which will be incredibly useful for us when formulating finite element problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, consider a surface $S$ in 3-dimensional space. We can integrate a function, say $f$, across the surface of $S$ by way of a **surface integral**. A surface integral is written $\\iint_S f(x,y,z) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$ using two integral signs. $\\mathrm{d}S$ is called the **surface element**. It denotes an infinitesimal area of $S$, similarly to how $\\mathrm{d}x$ denotes an infinitesimal step across the $x$-axis. The form $\\mathrm{d}S$ takes depends on $S$ itself. If $S$ lies flat in the $xy$-plane $\\mathrm{d}S=\\mathrm{d}y\\mathrm{d}x$. Then to evaluate the integral, we need to set up the bounds of integration. The simplest case is when $S$ is a rectangle, defined by $a \\leq x \\leq b$ and $c \\leq y \\leq d$ for some $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then the bounds are just going to be those constants. To integrate $f$ over this domain, we calculate $\\int_a^b \\int_c^d f \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Here the order of integration does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting example would be if $S$ was defined as a non-rectangular shape. Suppose that we wish to evaluate the integral of $f$ over the area between the curve $y=x^2$ and the line $y=4$. A graph of this area has been plotted below, using matplotlib and numpy. To solve, we first we decide on the order of integration. It makes sense here to integrate along the $y$-axis first, because our curves are defined in the form $y=g(x)$. When we perform the integration, we should imagine splitting the domain into strips along whatever axis we first integrate over. In this case it will be vertical strips. These strips are infinatesimally small, but are helpful to visualise what is going on. At the strip $x=1$ we should be integrating from $1$ to $4$. At $x=\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$ we integrate from $2$ to $4$. In fact at every $x$, we are integrating from $y=x^2$ to $y=4$. Therefore, it makes sense to write this as the bounds of our inner integral $\\int_{x^2}^4 f \\, \\mathrm{d}y$. Then, all the outer integral needs to do is fix the horizontal bounds over which these strips are defined. We need to go from the left-most point to the right-most point, which is from $x=-2$ to $x=2$. Hence the full integral can be written $\\int_{-2}^2 \\int_{x^2}^4 f \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\mathrm{d}x$."

    "This idea can be extended to 3 dimensions, where it is called the **volume integral**. It follows the same conceptual idea as the surface integral and takes the form $\\iiint_V f(x,y,z) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$. For volume integrals, it is always the case that $\\mathrm{d}V = \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y\\mathrm{d}z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving back to surfaces, we should point out that a surface may not always lie in the $xy$-plane, and for most real world applications, it won't. This is where the more powerful equation for a surface integral comes in to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\iint _{S} f \\,\\mathrm{d}S = \\iint _{T} f (\\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}(s,t)) \\left\\lVert \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}}{\\partial s}\\times \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}}{\\partial t}\\right\\rVert\\mathrm {d} s\\,\\mathrm {d} t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used a bit of shorthand here. $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}$ is just shorthand for a generic point on our surface. It is now a function of $s$ and $t$ because we have **parameterised** it with a new coordinate system. Let's consider an example. We can integrate $1$ over the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. Doing this should give us the surface area $4 \\pi R^2$. Firstly, we need to parameterise. We have a very useful transformation from cartesian coordinates, that is perfectly suited to the equation of a sphere. These are called **spherical coordinates**. Recall that spherical coordinates are defined by $x=R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$, $y=R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi$ and $z=R\\cos\\theta$. Therefore, the equation of our surface is $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}(\\theta,\\phi) = (R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, R\\cos\\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we calculate the partial derivates we need, which are $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\theta} = (R\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi, R\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi, -R\\sin\\theta), \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\phi} = (-R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, R\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the magnitude of the cross product of these two is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\lVert \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}}{\\partial s}\\times \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\underline{r}}}{\\partial t} \\right\\rVert = \\left\\lVert (R^2\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\phi, R^2\\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\phi, R^2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta) \\right\\rVert = R^2\\sin\\theta\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\phi + \\sin^2\\theta\\sin^2\\phi + \\cos^2\\phi} \\\\ = R^2\\sin\\theta\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta(\\cos^2\\phi + \\sin^2\\phi) + \\cos^2\\phi} \\\\ = R^2\\sin\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $\\mathrm{d}S = R^2\\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$. This result can always be used for spherical coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can perform the integration. Recall that in spherical coordinates, $\\theta$ represents the polar angle (vertical), and varies between $0$ and $\\pi$, and $\\phi$ represents the azimuthal angle (horizontal) and varies between $0$ and $2\\pi$. These will be our limits of integration since we want to integrate over the entire sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*} \\mathrm{SA} &= \\iint_S \\, \\mathrm{d}S \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi R^2\\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi \\\\ \n",
    "&= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[ -R^2\\cos\\theta \\right]_0^\\pi  \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int_0^{2\\pi} 2R^2  \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi \\\\\n",
    "&= \\left[ 2R^2\\phi \\right]_0^{2\\pi} \\\\\n",
    "&= 4 \\pi R^2 \\end{align*}\n",

    "So we have covered multiple dimensional integration, but the concept can be further extended. Instead of just calculating surface integrals of scalar functions, we can define something called **flux**, which is a way of calculating the integral of a vector field over some surface.\n",
    "Informally, flux is the amount of a vector field that passes through a given surface. The more perpendicular the vector field is to the surface, the greater the flux. Consider again our surface $S$, but now define a vector field $F$ over the same domain. If we want to know how much of the field is passing through the surface, we take the can consider a single surface element $\\mathrm{dS}$, as seen below."
